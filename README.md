# mern-book-search
Refactored MERN React Site using GraphQL and ApolloServer.

## Description

The task was to take an existing React site using RESTful API and refactor it to use GraphQL and ApolloServer. I did run out of time to fully implement the all of the existing features. As it stands, you can create an account and save books to your account. You cannot view existing books nor log back into an existing account. I believe I may have made some missteps somewhere in the backend when implementing my typDefs and Resolvers. I'm also certain that some of the React components need more additional work but I lack time. I will come back to this project so that I can work on my MERN stack skills and implement the necessary features.


## Usage

Click on the deployed link below to access the site. Alternatively, you can clone this repo, view the files yourself, and start a local server. Open a new terminal and follow the steps below. 

Mongod must be running in the background (or just use MongoDB Compass).

```
1. npm install
2. npm run dev
```
